My simple project called Car Rental System allows the user to rent a car and choose the car brand, model, license plate number, and check if the car is available or not. I also added a GUI and connected the project to a PostgreSQL database.

Difficulties: The most difficult part of this project was adding the database and linking the code and buttons to the database itself. My project turned out to be very simple, but even this I consider an achievement.

During the project, I watched many videos on YouTube, asked for help from AI, searched different websites, and talked to my classmates. The project could have been much better, but unfortunately, I had very little time left. I fully understand that I didnâ€™t approach the project responsibly.

However, I want to mention that this work was very interesting for me, and in the future, I plan to learn more about how databases work, what types there are, and try to improve my project.
