Overview of the "Car Rental System".
Purpose and goals of the project.


My simple project called Car Rental System allows the user to add, delete, update, export, reset information about a car and write the car brand, model, license plate number, and write if the car is available or not. I also added a GUI and connected the project to a PostgreSQL database.

Difficulties: The most difficult part of this project was adding the database and linking the code and buttons to the database itself. My project turned out to be very simple, but even this I consider an achievement.

During the project, I watched many videos on YouTube, asked for help from AI, searched different websites, and ask help from my classmates. The project could have been much better, but unfortunately, that takes a 
lot of time and energies. I fully understand that I didnâ€™t approach the project responsibly.

However, I want to mention that this work was very interesting for me, and in the future, I plan to learn more about how databases work, what types there are, and try to improve my project.
